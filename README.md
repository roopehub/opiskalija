<p> I created a fun project for mostly learning purposes but soon figured out that there might actually be a need for this type of project because there's no quite similiar 'app' out there (at least to my knowledge)</p>

<p> I used mostly ReactJS library for this project with leafletJS (+React-leaflet).</p>
<i>I also used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to create a foundation for the project.</i>


<p> I have used ~2weeks for this so it's not too finely tuned and might lack some features. Also the datacollection is a major obstacle for the site to be used widely</p>
